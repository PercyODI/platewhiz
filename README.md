## Possible Mealplanning strategies

Need to think about how to buildup meal plans. The core should be the same:

1. Pull all recipes, pantry, leftovers, and previous meals into memory.
2. Score each recipe based on the current state, and then pick the top recipe
3. Update state, and repeat.

### One Meal At A Time

The one meal at a time strategy is a very straight-foward approach: Going meal by meal, starting with Monday breakfast and ending with Sunday dinner (or desert), pick the top scoring recipe for that meal.

Advantages:

- Straightforward approach. Easy to think about and conceptualize.

Disadvantages:

- Hard to plan for specific days. For example, if I know I have game night on Thursday and don't have time to cook then previous meals have to provide leftovers.
- Hard to think through weekly themes?
- Could make rebuild difficult. Because everything is done one meal at a time, axing one meal could completely redo the mealplan when a simple recipe substitution would do.
- Hard to meal prep. This strategy would work well for cooking every meal as it comes up, but it could be more difficult to come up with good recipes that meal prep together.

### Top Three (name tbd)

In top three, three recipes are picked from the scoring system. Based on possible rules, these meals can have their prep steps laid out such that a majority of them can be meal prepped ahead of time. 

From there, the meals and their leftovers are distributed amongst the meals based on rules, calendars, etc.
