# PlateWhiz Data Setup

This data directory contains the basic database set up for platewhiz.

This data should be considered a starting place for local development, and and the initial seed for new databases. 

It should NOT be used in prod more than once.

NOTE:

I know this isn't ideal, but it's not worth it at this time to build a fully fleshed out migration system with mongodb.
